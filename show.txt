Q1. binary to decimal
    1 1 1 0          1 1 0 0
    128 64 32 16     8 4 2 1
    4 + 8 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 236

Q2. decimal to binary
    32 == 0010 0000
    2 == 0000 0010
    34 == 0010 0010

Q3. Decode hex 0xC4A to base 10
    0123456789ABCDEF
    d_num += number * base**i
    10 * 16 ** 0 = 10
    4 * 16 ** 1 = 64
    12 * 16 ** 2 = 3072
    10 + 64 + 3073 = 3146

Q4. Encode 79 into hex
    79 / 16 = 4 remainder 15 = F
    4/16 0 = 4

Q6. Describe binary search.
    Put it in a list if not already
    First find the middle by dividing the length
    of the list by 2.
    Then check if the middle index is higher or
    lower then your target.
    If lower then you omit everything higher then your middle
    and find the middle of the new array again by taking
    the middle divided by 2. Check and repeat.
    If higher then you omit everything lower then your middle
    and find the middle of the new array again by taking the middle
    of the new array divided by 2. check and repeat.
    Repeat until the target is the middle number or there are
    no numbers left.
